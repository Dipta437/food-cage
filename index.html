                <h2>Salad</h2>
                <p>Southerners have a lot of expressions to relay their dislike of the summer's heat. "Hotter'n blue blazes" and "hotter than the hinges on the gates of Hades" are two I always remember hearing in my childhood. But there's another truth about the South in the summer: It's one of the most delicious places to be. As gardens come into peak ripeness and farmers' markets fill up with produce, the South is a really special place to be.</p>

                <p>We all know grandmas are the best cooks. It's part of the job description. Under "Grandmother," the line item reads "must make everything that is delicious and comforting." But a grandmother's knack for making delicious food is only increased when they just so happen to be Southern. A Southern cook that is also a grandmother? You've hit the food lottery.</p>
